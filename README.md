## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned when to use flexbox and especially when to not use it. I learned the difference between inline and block elements, how to identify them.

I learned how flex/grid specific properties work.

I learned how to use figma and stick to a very specific and precise design.

### Continued development

I would like to work more with grid layout and flexbox. I also would like to improve on basic css properties and avoid useless/messy codes.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me a lot to understand flexbox behavior.
- [block/inline](https://la-cascade.io/articles/la-difference-entre-block-et-inline) - This french site helped me deeply understand the difference between block and inline elements.
